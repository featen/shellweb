# Write http server with single shell script

## Is it useful and safe
No, not at all...


## Then... why
In my opinion, the only 3 programming languages anyone would need forever is C, Shell and Golang.

- You can do system programming in C.
- System admin in Shell.
- And everything else in Golang.

But can we do something more than just system admin with shell scripts.

Yes, we can.

## What's behind
Shell is way more than you think, look deeper...
